# Team-Software-Project
Created a University Crisis Management platform that included an automated chatbot
We were required to develop a learning platform that may be used in university  environments in the event of crises situations (such as virus outbreaks or other forms of  unplanned disruption). Ideas for such a platform required research into ways for  conducting remote teaching and learning, gaining access to particular resources or  facilities, maintaining collaborative working and communication, and conducting  assessments in a robust manner. We worked as a team to produce the required  materials such as background research, concept designs, project planning, development  methods, and representative or even working prototypes towards the realisation of such an  application.
